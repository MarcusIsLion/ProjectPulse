# ProjectPulse

This project is made for web developpers who want to have a quick overview of their project's health.
But it's not only that, it also provides a way to keep track of the project's progress and to see how the project is evolving over time. You can also create a project with a base structure to create all files and directory needed for a new project.
You can also create your own structure and save it to use it later.
